## Determining True Flux and Magnitude of a Star From Deep-Sky Image of eQuinox Telescope by Performing Photometry on Python

### Abstract
A course of study to estimate the true flux and the magnitude of an object from the deep-sky image of eQuinox telescope. PSF Photometry is carried out on Python packages while noise and non-astronomical characteristics produced by the telescope are taken into account while preparing images. Final result is produced by evaluating the Calibration Factor using the Photometric data of the Reference and Test star.
